--> It started back in 1993 when the computer users were given access to the Internet which resulted in the massive increase of computer ownership in the states.

--> So beacause of these factors many investors were eager to invest in any dot com company(the company that does most of its business on internet).

--> There was a rapid increase in stock prices during these years in which many investors overlook the P/E ratio and base confidence which lead to a stock market bubble.

--> People quitting their jobs to trade in financial market became very common.

--> Investment banks also encouranged the investement in technology as they were getting profited significantly from IPO (initial public offferings).

--> Result of this (lower interest rates) made an increase in start up companies in which most of them lacked foundation and characteristics.

--> But soon people realised that they were'nt making any profit out of it so they stop investing in those companies. 

--> So in 2000 the dot-com bubble burst and many start up went out of business after 
    burning (giving offers for free or at a discount to build brand awareness and in future they can make profit out of this services that they provided) 
    their capital and failing to make profit out of it.

--> NASDAQ stock market index fall from 400% to 78% and by 2002 it gave up all its gains during bubble.

--> Few company survived like amazon,Cisco Systems but suffered rapid downfall.As the growth of the technology stabilized these companies gained market share.
